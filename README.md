# FdF
It is my first graphic project.
This project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a
relief landscape. In this project I was using graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed
internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal
with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse.
To compile it use Makefile. The executable will have name fdf. Test maps you can find into maps directory.
